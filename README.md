# ðŸšš Work-Scheduling Platform

A lightweight logistics dispatcher where **drivers** start shifts and receive **loads** (pickup â†’ drop-off), and **admins** create loads and track status.  
The system auto-dispatches loads to eligible on-shift drivers and tracks progress through stops. For detailed information about the project, refer to the PDF file `SystemFlow.pdf`.
